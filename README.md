## Description

VentNote allows users to capture experiences on the go.

Adventures in life come in all different forms. You maybe love to hike every weekend, ski all the best powder in the world, visit all the top-notch wineries or love finding the best hidden treasure cafes. What it is, these experiences matter to you so you should have somewhere that you can record these and access them whenever, wherever. VentNote is that special place.

This application was built using React & Material UI for the front end, GraphQL with Node.js and Express server and MongoDB and the mongoose ODM for the database.
